# Pairity

## What is Pairity

Pairity is an pair management tool. Unlike other tools we've used to manage pair rotations, Pairity extends the concept of team-based pairing to include cross-team pair management and active pair-matching where sought after roles are matched with user role profiles and tech stacks are matched to technologies user indicate they have competence or would like to gain competence in.
