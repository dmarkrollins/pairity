## What is Pairity

Pairity is a pair management tool.

If you don't know what pairing is read [this](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/pair-programming-considered-extremely-beneficial).

Unlike other tools we've used to manage pair rotations, Pairity extends the concept of team-based pairing to include:

- Cross-team pair management/rotation
- Active cross team pair-matching based on needed role and technology competency
- Include roles other than just engineering
- Cross role pairing (engineering/product, product/design, design/engineering)

## Core Features

- Same team paring
- Cross team pairing
- Cross role pairing
- Team management and inter/intra team pairing metrics
